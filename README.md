# Bitcoin.de WebSocket client (socket.io)

Code artifacts included with this repository have been forked from the https://github.com/matthiaslinden/bitcoinDE_API 
repository. The API has been tested against Python 3.7 (especially a remote Python configuration using Docker). See the original
repository for further details about implemented API client functionality.

## Changes

* added Docker support
* fixed code issues (code has been aligned with PEP-8)
* fixed typos, and also removed informational comments
* adjusted OOP-design (made changes to inheritance)
* disabled ws1-endpoint, since this one does not seem to work without issues
